## Description

This project was a quiz where the user will need to choose between multiple questions and choices. If the user choose a wrong answer the time is reduce. At the end of the quiz the user score will be the time left of the timer. The user can save multiple scores.

I found this project the most challenging. Due to, I had to implement lot of new things. I struggle a lot with looping over the questions and answers and creating a button for each question. Also I struggle with local storage.

I take more time finding a solution to the problem than writen the code, also I had to refactor the code that I made at the beginning due to, I was repeting myself a lot.

I am happy that I could make the quiz work and without errors.
